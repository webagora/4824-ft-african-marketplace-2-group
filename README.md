##  African marketplace

###  Pitch 

Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. 

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listing for items they have for sale. 

### MVP

1. A small business `owner` can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.

2. They can also make listing for `items` they want to sell, which will show up to all `users`.

3. They add a new `item` by selecting their market `location` and typing in their item's `name`, `description`, and `price`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**Stretch**

1. A business owner can upload their picture to their profile.
